## Project Title

*Hello World Sample - My first repository*

## Description  
Practicing GitHub by creating my first repository. Testing out different functions and seeing how the results look. When doing this for real projects, make sure I add multiple paragraphs explaining what was done, what was accomplished, the outcomes, results, etc. 

## Tools Used  
Examples of tools used could be **Python, Excel, Power BI, websites, etc.**   

## Files Used  

## How to Run Program  
Running a program depends on the software you are using. I am most experienced in Python, but I am still a beginner in it. I currently use Spyder, it is really easy to use and I like it alot. I enjoy being able to check my code easily as I am writing it. This does not explain how to run a program. I just wanted a paragraph here. 

## Additional Information  
**This was to help us understand the structure, markdown technique, etc.**
